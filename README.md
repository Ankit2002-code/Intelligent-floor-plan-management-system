# Floor Plan Management System

## ðŸ§­ Overview

The **Floor Plan Management System** is a full-stack web application designed to efficiently manage floor plans for an organization. It supports versioning, room-level details, and admin-level access control.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- **Admin Panel**: Allows admin users to update and manage floor plans.
- **Version Control**: Automatically versions each update, with complete version history.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Timestamp and role-based resolution system (admin has priority).
- **Dynamic UI**: React-based interface for viewing, updating, and managing plans.
- **Role-based Access**: Admin vs. regular user restrictions enforced on update actions.

## ðŸ§© Pages in Application

The app contains 5 main routes/pages:

- `/` â†’ **Home** â€“ Overview and introduction
- `/login` â†’ **Login Page** â€“ User login functionality
- `/view` â†’ **View Plans** â€“ Browse floor plans by version and user
- `/update` â†’ **Update Plans** â€“ Admin-only panel to submit/edit floor plans
- `/history` â†’ **Version History** â€“ Browse all available versions

## ðŸ”’ Authentication

- **Static authentication** implemented in frontend/backend.
- Only users with admin roles can **update** or **delete** plans.
- All users can **view** floor plans and version history.

## ðŸ§  Complexity & Optimization

- **GET Requests**: Optimized with constant-time lookup (given version).
- **POST Requests**: Inserts are optimized; handled by Hibernate with minimal overhead.
- **Space Complexity**: Minimal due to normalized floor-room data structure.

## âš  Error Handling

- Backend wrapped in `try-catch` blocks for major operations.
- Frontend enforces type and value validation on inputs.
- Graceful error messages for user operations (e.g., unauthorized update attempt).
